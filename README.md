# java-ThreeCardBrag
A basic implementation of classes and methods for a game of Three Card Brag.

Written at a java training day. Published work is my own but borrows implementation notes, designs and directives from the tutor.

Program is unfinished (it isn't a playable game, as such) but contains many of the necessary methods of creating a deck of cards, shuffling, drawing three and then assessing if it is a Flush, Straight Flush, Pair, and so on.

Comments and feedback welcome.
